# ðŸš€ Mars Dashboard 



### Project Details

This is a Mars rover dashboard that consumes the NASA API. The dashboard allows the user to select which rover's information they want to view. Once they have selected a rover, they will be able to see the most recent images taken by that rover, as well as important information about the rover and its mission. My app uses many of the functional concepts and practices I have learned in this course, with a focus on pure functions, and reshaping, and accessing information from complex API responses. 

### Getting Started

We have supplied some of the foundational code for you. So follow these steps to get started:

1. We'll start with the typical setup - clone this repo and install the dependencies


 - [ ] For this project I am using yarn as my package manager, so to install your depencies run:

```yarn install``` 

2. Run `yarn start` in your terminal and go to `http:localhost:3000` to check that your app is working.
